# Nvidia 

## Overview and Origin

Nvidia is a software company specializing in GPUs (graphics processing units), APIs (application programming interfaces), and system on a chip units (SoCs). They’re also a dominant supplier of AI (artificial intelligence) software and hardware.
These products are primarily utilized in smartphones and tablets, vehicle navigation software, and entertainment systems.
_The company is valued at over $1 trillion._
* Name of company:
Nvidia.
* When was the company incorporated?
Nvidia was incorporated in 1993.
* Who are the founders of the company?
The founders of Nvidia are Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The three founders were all engineers at other companies and had a bullish vision on the future of graphics acceleration, particularly because of the booming video game industry. They started and received 20 million in VC funding.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
They started with $40k in the bank and subsequently raised $20 million from VCs. They are now valued at over $1 trillion.

## Business Activities

Nvidia’s product suite is comprised of graphics processing units, wireless communication devices, and automotive software and hardware.
An example of graphics processing is GeForce, which is a consumer-oriented graphics processing product.
An example of wireless communication is nForce, a motherboard chipset used inIntel and AMD microprocessors.
An example of automative software is Drive, which is a range of hardware and software products for designers and manufacturers of autonomous vehicles.
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Nvidia is still focused on the primary areas described above where much of its revenue still comes from, with more of a focus recently on AI and machine learning as its market value rises accordingly.
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Nvidia has a range of customers depending on the products they sell, but the majority of their revenue-producing business is B2B. Their net income is listed as over $29 billion, with customers such as Deloitte, Amgen, Microsoft, Sony, T-Mobile, & BMW.
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Nvidia’s primary competitor has been AMD (Advanced Micro Devices), and what’s made Nvidia unique is not its GPU product itself, but the programming features around CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). AMD is known to have a cheaper product with better value for certain subsets of customers, in particular, gaming.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Technology – GPUs, AI chipmaking.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
GPUs: specialized GPUs, cloud GPUs, multi-chip modules (MCMs), integrated, hybrid, new business models, AI-based rendering.
Wireless comms: edge computing, 5g, AI, wireless sensor networks.
Automotive software/hardware: electrification, AI, cybersecurity, regulatory compliance
Broader AI: generative AI, AI ethics, personalized AI, healthcare AI, multimodal AI, cybersecurity, conversational AI
* What are the other major companies in this field?
AMD has been the primary competitor to Nvidia since the beginning. Most internet sources seem to compare the two companies’ graphics cards which are utilized by individual consumers in gaming.
In terms of chips, Intel is the primary mainstay competitor to Nvidia, with cloud tech companies like Google, Amazon, & Meta also developing their own chips. Cerebras and SambaNova are competitors in the sense they’ve developed chip architecture to improve generative AI functionalities.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Huge. Many companies rely on Nvidia’s chips and tech to run their core products. The primary driver to this success has been the CUDA technology described above. But the company has increasingly more competition in the chip space, and the average costs to run Nvidia chips can be upwards of $30k. This makes cheaper alternatives a need in the market, particularly one that’s been dominated by Nvidia for over 30 years.
A new competitor, D-Matrix, came onto the scene in 2019, for instance. Their semiconductor technology could be a threat to Nvidia as their primary purpose is to reduce the cost of running AI models.
Meanwhile, AMD encourages the marketplace optionality by encouraging customers that there will be more and more options in the future for chips.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
I think revenue is most important when valuing a company. Nvidia surpassed Intel in early 2024 in revenue ($61B vs $54B). AMD, for reference, is at $6B.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
As mentioned above, Nvidia’s core concern right now is potentially cheaper alternatives coming into the marketplace. Right now, they’re dominating the market and have no real competition for the majority of their products.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
With the uptick in average consumer interest in AI, and with the fact that consumer-facing names like Google, Meta, and Amazon are working to produce their own chips, Nvidia could stand to create a better consumer-facing brand and reputation. Social media, new products, and their visibility in stock market headlines are all good ways to think about this.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Consumers drive markets & end revenues. Nvidia’s primary revenues are all from B2B and rely on the products being sold by their clients for revenue. This model has worked well so far, but with heightening chip competition, they could focus more on their DTC presence. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Since CUDA is what seems to make Nvidia most unique and successful, I would say making that accessible and understandable to the average consumer might help bolster their branding.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
As someone completely new to coding and data architecture, I’m not completely sure on the answer yet, but from all the sources I’ve read for this project, CUDA seems to hold the secret to why Nvidia’s been so successful in the B2B space. Can’t that translate to DTC? Nvidia is already successful in DTC with their gaming chip, but this is highly specialized and depending on the user's preferences, the user may choose AMD. Especially with headlines about Nvidia's stock hitting consistently over the past 9 months, it's a good time to bolster consumer perception.
